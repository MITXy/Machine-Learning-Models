# Chun Modelling with Pycaret

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate how to use the Pycaret library to perform Chun modeling. Chun modeling is a form of machine learning that uses a combination of clustering and regression techniques to predict the value of a continuous target variable.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `notebooks`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use Pycaret for Chun modeling. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of the modeling process, from data preparation and feature engineering to model selection and evaluation.


- `data`: A directory containing sample datasets that can be used to follow along with the Jupyter notebooks or to test the Python scripts.


## Requirements

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pycaret 2.0 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

You can install Pycaret and its dependencies using `pip`:


## Usage

To get started with Chun modeling using Pycaret, you can follow along with the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. These notebooks provide step-by-step instructions for each stage of the modeling process, from loading and preprocessing data to selecting the best model and making predictions.
