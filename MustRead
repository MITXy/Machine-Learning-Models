# Machine Learning Model

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for various machine learning models. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, from basic classification and regression models to more advanced techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `notebooks`: A directory containing Jupyter notebooks for various machine learning models. Each notebook includes detailed explanations of the data preparation, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation process for the specific model.

- `src`: A directory containing Python scripts that can be used to train and evaluate the machine learning models on new datasets. These scripts are designed to be used in a production environment, where new data is regularly ingested and models need to be updated and retrained.

- `data`: A directory containing sample datasets that can be used to follow along with the Jupyter notebooks or to test the Python scripts.

- `LICENSE`: A file containing the license under which this repository is distributed (MIT License).

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras libraries

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:


## Usage

To get started with machine learning using this repository, you can browse the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory. Each notebook focuses on a specific machine learning technique, and provides detailed explanations of how to prepare data, engineer features, train models, and evaluate performance.

If you want to use these machine learning models on your own data, you can use the Python scripts in the `src` directory as a starting point. These scripts demonstrate how to load and preprocess data, create and train machine learning models, and save the models to disk for later use.
